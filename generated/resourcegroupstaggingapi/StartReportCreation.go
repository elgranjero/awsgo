package resourcegroupstaggingapi

// StartReportCreation is generated as a reference stub.
// Executable command wiring lives under cmd/resourcegroupstaggingapi.go.
//
// Generates a report that lists all tagged resources in the accounts across your
// organization and tells whether each resource is compliant with the effective tag
// policy. Compliance data is refreshed daily. The report is generated
// asynchronously.
//
// The generated report is saved to the following location:
//
// s3://amzn-s3-demo-bucket/AwsTagPolicies/o-exampleorgid/YYYY-MM-ddTHH:mm:ssZ/report.csv
//
// For more information about evaluating resource compliance with tag policies,
// including the required permissions, review [Permissions for evaluating organization-wide compliance]in the Tagging Amazon Web Services
// Resources and Tag Editor user guide.
//
// You can call this operation only from the organization's management account and
// from the us-east-1 Region.
//
// If the account associated with the identity used to call StartReportCreation is
// different from the account that owns the Amazon S3 bucket, there must be a
// bucket policy attached to the bucket to provide access. For more information,
// review [Amazon S3 bucket policy for report storage]in the Tagging Amazon Web Services Resources and Tag Editor user guide.
