// CreateExportTask is generated as a reference stub.
// Executable command wiring lives under cmd/cloudwatchlogs.go.
//
// Creates an export task so that you can efficiently export data from a log group
// to an Amazon S3 bucket. When you perform a CreateExportTask operation, you must
// use credentials that have permission to write to the S3 bucket that you specify
// as the destination.
//
// Exporting log data to S3 buckets that are encrypted by KMS is supported.
// Exporting log data to Amazon S3 buckets that have S3 Object Lock enabled with a
// retention period is also supported.
//
// Exporting to S3 buckets that are encrypted with AES-256 is supported.
//
// This is an asynchronous call. If all the required information is provided, this
// operation initiates an export task and responds with the ID of the task. After
// the task has started, you can use [DescribeExportTasks]to get the status of the export task. Each
// account can only have one active ( RUNNING or PENDING ) export task at a time.
// To cancel an export task, use [CancelExportTask].
//
// You can export logs from multiple log groups or multiple time ranges to the
// same S3 bucket. To separate log data for each export task, specify a prefix to
// be used as the Amazon S3 key prefix for all exported objects.
//
// We recommend that you don't regularly export to Amazon S3 as a way to
// continuously archive your logs. For that use case, we instead recommend that you
// use subscriptions. For more information about subscriptions, see [Real-time processing of log data with subscriptions].
//
// Time-based sorting on chunks of log data inside an exported file is not
// guaranteed. You can sort the exported log field data by using Linux utilities.
