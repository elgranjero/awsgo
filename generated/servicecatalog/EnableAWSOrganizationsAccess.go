// EnableAWSOrganizationsAccess is generated as a reference stub.
// Executable command wiring lives under cmd/servicecatalog.go.
//
// Enable portfolio sharing feature through Organizations. This API will allow
// Service Catalog to receive updates on your organization in order to sync your
// shares with the current structure. This API can only be called by the management
// account in the organization.
//
// When you call this API, Service Catalog calls
// organizations:EnableAWSServiceAccess on your behalf so that your shares stay in
// sync with any changes in your Organizations structure.
//
// Note that a delegated administrator is not authorized to invoke
// EnableAWSOrganizationsAccess .
//
// If you have previously disabled Organizations access for Service Catalog, and
// then enable access again, the portfolio access permissions might not sync with
// the latest changes to the organization structure. Specifically, accounts that
// you removed from the organization after disabling Service Catalog access, and
// before you enabled access again, can retain access to the previously shared
// portfolio. As a result, an account that has been removed from the organization
// might still be able to create or manage Amazon Web Services resources when it is
// no longer authorized to do so. Amazon Web Services is working to resolve this
// issue.
