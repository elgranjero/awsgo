// Evaluates the given code and returns the response. The code definition
// requirements depend on the specified runtime. For APPSYNC_JS runtimes, the code
// defines the request and response functions. The request function takes the
// incoming request after a GraphQL operation is parsed and converts it into a
// request configuration for the selected data source operation. The response
// function interprets responses from the data source and maps it to the shape of
// the GraphQL field output type.
