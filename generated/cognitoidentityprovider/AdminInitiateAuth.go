//
// Starts sign-in for applications with a server-side component, for example a
// traditional web application. This operation specifies the authentication flow
// that you'd like to begin. The authentication flow that you specify must be
// supported in your app client configuration. For more information about
// authentication flows, see [Authentication flows].
//
// This action might generate an SMS text message. Starting June 1, 2021, US
// telecom carriers require you to register an origination phone number before you
// can send SMS messages to US phone numbers. If you use SMS text messages in
// Amazon Cognito, you must register a phone number with [Amazon Pinpoint]. Amazon Cognito uses the
// registered number automatically. Otherwise, Amazon Cognito users who must
// receive SMS messages might not be able to sign up, activate their accounts, or
// sign in.
//
// If you have never used SMS text messages with Amazon Cognito or any other
// Amazon Web Services service, Amazon Simple Notification Service might place your
// account in the SMS sandbox. In [sandbox mode], you can send messages only to verified phone
// numbers. After you test your app while in the sandbox environment, you can move
// out of the sandbox and into production. For more information, see [SMS message settings for Amazon Cognito user pools]in the Amazon
// Cognito Developer Guide.
//
// Amazon Cognito evaluates Identity and Access Management (IAM) policies in
// requests for this API operation. For this operation, you must use IAM
// credentials to authorize requests, and you must grant yourself the corresponding
// IAM permission in a policy.
