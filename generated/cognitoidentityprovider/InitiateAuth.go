package cognitoidentityprovider

// InitiateAuth is generated as a reference stub.
// Executable command wiring lives under cmd/cognitoidentityprovider.go.
//
// Declares an authentication flow and initiates sign-in for a user in the Amazon
// Cognito user directory. Amazon Cognito might respond with an additional
// challenge or an AuthenticationResult that contains the outcome of a successful
// authentication. You can't sign in a user with a federated IdP with InitiateAuth
// . For more information, see [Authentication].
//
// Amazon Cognito doesn't evaluate Identity and Access Management (IAM) policies
// in requests for this API operation. For this operation, you can't use IAM
// credentials to authorize requests, and you can't grant IAM permissions in
// policies. For more information about authorization models in Amazon Cognito, see
// [Using the Amazon Cognito user pools API and user pool endpoints].
//
// This action might generate an SMS text message. Starting June 1, 2021, US
// telecom carriers require you to register an origination phone number before you
// can send SMS messages to US phone numbers. If you use SMS text messages in
// Amazon Cognito, you must register a phone number with [Amazon Pinpoint]. Amazon Cognito uses the
// registered number automatically. Otherwise, Amazon Cognito users who must
// receive SMS messages might not be able to sign up, activate their accounts, or
// sign in.
//
// If you have never used SMS text messages with Amazon Cognito or any other
// Amazon Web Services service, Amazon Simple Notification Service might place your
// account in the SMS sandbox. In [sandbox mode], you can send messages only to verified phone
// numbers. After you test your app while in the sandbox environment, you can move
// out of the sandbox and into production. For more information, see [SMS message settings for Amazon Cognito user pools]in the Amazon
// Cognito Developer Guide.
