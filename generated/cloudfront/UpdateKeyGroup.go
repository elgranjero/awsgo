// When you update a key group, all the fields are updated with the values
// provided in the request. You cannot update some fields independent of others. To
// update a key group:
//
// - Get the current key group with GetKeyGroup or GetKeyGroupConfig .
//
// - Locally modify the fields in the key group that you want to update. For
// example, add or remove public key IDs.
//
// - Call UpdateKeyGroup with the entire key group object, including the fields
// that you modified and those that you didn't.
