// Executable command wiring lives under cmd/cloudfront.go.
//
// Deletes a real-time log configuration.
//
// You cannot delete a real-time log configuration if it's attached to a cache
// behavior. First update your distributions to remove the real-time log
// configuration from all cache behaviors, then delete the real-time log
// configuration.
//
// To delete a real-time log configuration, you can provide the configuration's
// name or its Amazon Resource Name (ARN). You must provide at least one. If you
// provide both, CloudFront uses the name to identify the real-time log
// configuration to delete.
