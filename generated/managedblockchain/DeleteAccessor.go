//
// Deletes an accessor that your Amazon Web Services account owns. An accessor
// object is a container that has the information required for token based access
// to your Ethereum nodes including, the BILLING_TOKEN . After an accessor is
// deleted, the status of the accessor changes from AVAILABLE to PENDING_DELETION .
// An accessor in the PENDING_DELETION state can’t be used for new WebSocket
// requests or HTTP requests. However, WebSocket connections that were initiated
// while the accessor was in the AVAILABLE state remain open until they expire (up
// to 2 hours).
