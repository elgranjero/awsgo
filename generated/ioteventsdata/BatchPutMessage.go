package ioteventsdata

// BatchPutMessage is generated as a reference stub.
// Executable command wiring lives under cmd/ioteventsdata.go.
//
// Sends a set of messages to the IoT Events system. Each message payload is
// transformed into the input you specify ( "inputName" ) and ingested into any
// detectors that monitor that input. If multiple messages are sent, the order in
// which the messages are processed isn't guaranteed. To guarantee ordering, you
// must send messages one at a time and wait for a successful response.
