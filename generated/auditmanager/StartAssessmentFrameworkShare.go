package auditmanager

// StartAssessmentFrameworkShare is generated as a reference stub.
// Executable command wiring lives under cmd/auditmanager.go.
//
// Creates a share request for a custom framework in Audit Manager.
//
// The share request specifies a recipient and notifies them that a custom
// framework is available. Recipients have 120 days to accept or decline the
// request. If no action is taken, the share request expires.
//
// When you create a share request, Audit Manager stores a snapshot of your custom
// framework in the US East (N. Virginia) Amazon Web Services Region. Audit Manager
// also stores a backup of the same snapshot in the US West (Oregon) Amazon Web
// Services Region.
//
// Audit Manager deletes the snapshot and the backup snapshot when one of the
// following events occurs:
//
// - The sender revokes the share request.
//
// - The recipient declines the share request.
//
// - The recipient encounters an error and doesn't successfully accept the share
// request.
//
// - The share request expires before the recipient responds to the request.
//
// When a sender [resends a share request], the snapshot is replaced with an updated version that
// corresponds with the latest version of the custom framework.
//
// When a recipient accepts a share request, the snapshot is replicated into their
// Amazon Web Services account under the Amazon Web Services Region that was
// specified in the share request.
//
// When you invoke the StartAssessmentFrameworkShare API, you are about to share a
// custom framework with another Amazon Web Services account. You may not share a
// custom framework that is derived from a standard framework if the standard
// framework is designated as not eligible for sharing by Amazon Web Services,
// unless you have obtained permission to do so from the owner of the standard
// framework. To learn more about which standard frameworks are eligible for
// sharing, see [Framework sharing eligibility]in the Audit Manager User Guide.
