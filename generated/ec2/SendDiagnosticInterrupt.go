package ec2

// SendDiagnosticInterrupt is generated as a reference stub.
// Executable command wiring lives under cmd/ec2.go.
//
// Sends a diagnostic interrupt to the specified Amazon EC2 instance to trigger a
// kernel panic (on Linux instances), or a blue screen/stop error (on Windows
// instances). For instances based on Intel and AMD processors, the interrupt is
// received as a non-maskable interrupt (NMI).
//
// In general, the operating system crashes and reboots when a kernel panic or
// stop error is triggered. The operating system can also be configured to perform
// diagnostic tasks, such as generating a memory dump file, loading a secondary
// kernel, or obtaining a call trace.
//
// Before sending a diagnostic interrupt to your instance, ensure that its
// operating system is configured to perform the required diagnostic tasks.
//
// For more information about configuring your operating system to generate a
// crash dump when a kernel panic or stop error occurs, see [Send a diagnostic interrupt (for advanced users)]in the Amazon EC2 User
// Guide.
