// DescribeInstanceCreditSpecifications is generated as a reference stub.
// Executable command wiring lives under cmd/ec2.go.
//
// Describes the credit option for CPU usage of the specified burstable
// performance instances. The credit options are standard and unlimited .
//
// If you do not specify an instance ID, Amazon EC2 returns burstable performance
// instances with the unlimited credit option, as well as instances that were
// previously configured as T2, T3, and T3a with the unlimited credit option. For
// example, if you resize a T2 instance, while it is configured as unlimited , to
// an M4 instance, Amazon EC2 returns the M4 instance.
//
// If you specify one or more instance IDs, Amazon EC2 returns the credit option (
// standard or unlimited ) of those instances. If you specify an instance ID that
// is not valid, such as an instance that is not a burstable performance instance,
// an error is returned.
//
// Recently terminated instances might appear in the returned results. This
// interval is usually less than one hour.
//
// If an Availability Zone is experiencing a service disruption and you specify
// instance IDs in the affected zone, or do not specify any instance IDs at all,
// the call fails. If you specify only instance IDs in an unaffected zone, the call
// works normally.
//
