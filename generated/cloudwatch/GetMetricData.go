package cloudwatch

// GetMetricData is generated as a reference stub.
// Executable command wiring lives under cmd/cloudwatch.go.
//
// You can use the GetMetricData API to retrieve CloudWatch metric values. The
// operation can also include a CloudWatch Metrics Insights query, and one or more
// metric math functions.
//
// A GetMetricData operation that does not include a query can retrieve as many as
// 500 different metrics in a single request, with a total of as many as 100,800
// data points. You can also optionally perform metric math expressions on the
// values of the returned statistics, to create new time series that represent new
// insights into your data. For example, using Lambda metrics, you could divide the
// Errors metric by the Invocations metric to get an error rate time series. For
// more information about metric math expressions, see [Metric Math Syntax and Functions]in the Amazon CloudWatch
// User Guide.
//
// If you include a Metrics Insights query, each GetMetricData operation can
// include only one query. But the same GetMetricData operation can also retrieve
// other metrics. Metrics Insights queries can query only the most recent three
// hours of metric data. For more information about Metrics Insights, see [Query your metrics with CloudWatch Metrics Insights].
//
// Calls to the GetMetricData API have a different pricing structure than calls to
// GetMetricStatistics . For more information about pricing, see [Amazon CloudWatch Pricing].
//
// Amazon CloudWatch retains metric data as follows:
//
// - Data points with a period of less than 60 seconds are available for 3
// hours. These data points are high-resolution metrics and are available only for
// custom metrics that have been defined with a StorageResolution of 1.
//
// - Data points with a period of 60 seconds (1-minute) are available for 15
// days.
//
// - Data points with a period of 300 seconds (5-minute) are available for 63
// days.
//
// - Data points with a period of 3600 seconds (1 hour) are available for 455
// days (15 months).
//
// Data points that are initially published with a shorter period are aggregated
// together for long-term storage. For example, if you collect data using a period
// of 1 minute, the data remains available for 15 days with 1-minute resolution.
// After 15 days, this data is still available, but is aggregated and retrievable
// only with a resolution of 5 minutes. After 63 days, the data is further
// aggregated and is available with a resolution of 1 hour.
//
// If you omit Unit in your request, all data that was collected with any unit is
// returned, along with the corresponding units that were specified when the data
// was reported to CloudWatch. If you specify a unit, the operation returns only
// data that was collected with that unit specified. If you specify a unit that
// does not match the data collected, the results of the operation are null.
// CloudWatch does not perform unit conversions.
//
// # Using Metrics Insights queries with metric math
//
// You can't mix a Metric Insights query and metric math syntax in the same
// expression, but you can reference results from a Metrics Insights query within
// other Metric math expressions. A Metrics Insights query without a GROUP BY
// clause returns a single time-series (TS), and can be used as input for a metric
// math expression that expects a single time series. A Metrics Insights query with
// a GROUP BY clause returns an array of time-series (TS[]), and can be used as
// input for a metric math expression that expects an array of time series.
