// DeleteBucketReplication is generated as a reference stub.
// Executable command wiring lives under cmd/s3control.go.
//
// This operation deletes an Amazon S3 on Outposts bucket's replication
// configuration. To delete an S3 bucket's replication configuration, see [DeleteBucketReplication]in the
// Amazon S3 API Reference.
//
// Deletes the replication configuration from the specified S3 on Outposts bucket.
//
// To use this operation, you must have permissions to perform the
// s3-outposts:PutReplicationConfiguration action. The Outposts bucket owner has
// this permission by default and can grant it to others. For more information
// about permissions, see [Setting up IAM with S3 on Outposts]and [Managing access to S3 on Outposts buckets] in the Amazon S3 User Guide.
//
// It can take a while to propagate PUT or DELETE requests for a replication
// configuration to all S3 on Outposts systems. Therefore, the replication
// configuration that's returned by a GET request soon after a PUT or DELETE
// request might return a more recent result than what's on the Outpost. If an
// Outpost is offline, the delay in updating the replication configuration on that
// Outpost can be significant.
//
// All Amazon S3 on Outposts REST API requests for this action require an
// additional parameter of x-amz-outpost-id to be passed with the request. In
// addition, you must use an S3 on Outposts endpoint hostname prefix instead of
// s3-control . For an example of the request syntax for Amazon S3 on Outposts that
// uses the S3 on Outposts endpoint hostname prefix and the x-amz-outpost-id
// derived by using the access point ARN, see the [Examples]section.
//
// For information about S3 replication on Outposts configuration, see [Replicating objects for S3 on Outposts] in the
