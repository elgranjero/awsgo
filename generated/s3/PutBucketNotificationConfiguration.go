package s3

// PutBucketNotificationConfiguration is generated as a reference stub.
// Executable command wiring lives under cmd/s3.go.
//
// This operation is not supported for directory buckets.
//
// Enables notifications of specified events for a bucket. For more information
// about event notifications, see [Configuring Event Notifications].
//
// Using this API, you can replace an existing notification configuration. The
// configuration is an XML file that defines the event types that you want Amazon
// S3 to publish and the destination where you want Amazon S3 to publish an event
// notification when it detects an event of the specified type.
//
// By default, your bucket has no event notifications configured. That is, the
// notification configuration will be an empty NotificationConfiguration .
//
// This action replaces the existing notification configuration with the
// configuration you include in the request body.
//
// After Amazon S3 receives this request, it first verifies that any Amazon Simple
// Notification Service (Amazon SNS) or Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS)
// destination exists, and that the bucket owner has permission to publish to it by
// sending a test notification. In the case of Lambda destinations, Amazon S3
// verifies that the Lambda function permissions grant Amazon S3 permission to
// invoke the function from the Amazon S3 bucket. For more information, see [Configuring Notifications for Amazon S3 Events].
//
// You can disable notifications by adding the empty NotificationConfiguration
// element.
//
// For more information about the number of event notification configurations that
// you can create per bucket, see [Amazon S3 service quotas]in Amazon Web Services General Reference.
//
// By default, only the bucket owner can configure notifications on a bucket.
// However, bucket owners can use a bucket policy to grant permission to other
// users to set this configuration with the required s3:PutBucketNotification
// permission.
//
// The PUT notification is an atomic operation. For example, suppose your
// notification configuration includes SNS topic, SQS queue, and Lambda function
// configurations. When you send a PUT request with this configuration, Amazon S3
// sends test messages to your SNS topic. If the message fails, the entire PUT
// action will fail, and Amazon S3 will not add the configuration to your bucket.
//
// If the configuration in the request body includes only one TopicConfiguration
// specifying only the s3:ReducedRedundancyLostObject event type, the response
// will also include the x-amz-sns-test-message-id header containing the message
// ID of the test notification sent to the topic.
//
// The following action is related to PutBucketNotificationConfiguration :
//
// [GetBucketNotificationConfiguration]
//
// You must URL encode any signed header values that contain spaces. For example,
// if your header value is my file.txt , containing two spaces after my , you must
// URL encode this value to my%20%20file.txt .
