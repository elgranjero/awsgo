// Retrieves OwnershipControls for an Amazon S3 bucket. To use this operation, you
// must have the s3:GetBucketOwnershipControls permission. For more information
// about Amazon S3 permissions, see [Specifying permissions in a policy].
//
// A bucket doesn't have OwnershipControls settings in the following cases:
//
// - The bucket was created before the BucketOwnerEnforced ownership setting was
// introduced and you've never explicitly applied this value
//
// - You've manually deleted the bucket ownership control value using the
// DeleteBucketOwnershipControls API operation.
//
// By default, Amazon S3 sets OwnershipControls for all newly created buckets.
//
// For information about Amazon S3 Object Ownership, see [Using Object Ownership].
