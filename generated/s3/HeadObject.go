package s3

// HeadObject is generated as a reference stub.
// Executable command wiring lives under cmd/s3.go.
//
// The HEAD operation retrieves metadata from an object without returning the
// object itself. This operation is useful if you're interested only in an object's
// metadata.
//
// A HEAD request has the same options as a GET operation on an object. The
// response is identical to the GET response except that there is no response
// body. Because of this, if the HEAD request generates an error, it returns a
// generic code, such as 400 Bad Request , 403 Forbidden , 404 Not Found , 405
// Method Not Allowed , 412 Precondition Failed , or 304 Not Modified . It's not
// possible to retrieve the exact exception of these error codes.
//
// Request headers are limited to 8 KB in size. For more information, see [Common Request Headers].
//
// Permissions
//
// - General purpose bucket permissions - To use HEAD , you must have the
// s3:GetObject permission. You need the relevant read object (or version)
// permission for this operation. For more information, see [Actions, resources, and condition keys for Amazon S3]in the Amazon S3
// User Guide. For more information about the permissions to S3 API operations by
// S3 resource types, see Required permissions for Amazon S3 API operationsin the Amazon S3 User Guide.
//
// If the object you request doesn't exist, the error that Amazon S3 returns
//
// depends on whether you also have the s3:ListBucket permission.
//
// - If you have the s3:ListBucket permission on the bucket, Amazon S3 returns an
// HTTP status code 404 Not Found error.
//
// - If you don’t have the s3:ListBucket permission, Amazon S3 returns an HTTP
// status code 403 Forbidden error.
//
// - Directory bucket permissions - To grant access to this API operation on a
// directory bucket, we recommend that you use the [CreateSession]CreateSession API operation
// for session-based authorization. Specifically, you grant the
// s3express:CreateSession permission to the directory bucket in a bucket policy
// or an IAM identity-based policy. Then, you make the CreateSession API call on
// the bucket to obtain a session token. With the session token in your request
// header, you can make API requests to this operation. After the session token
// expires, you make another CreateSession API call to generate a new session
// token for use. Amazon Web Services CLI or SDKs create session and refresh the
// session token automatically to avoid service interruptions when a session
// expires. For more information about authorization, see [CreateSession]CreateSession .
//
// If you enable x-amz-checksum-mode in the request and the object is encrypted
//
// with Amazon Web Services Key Management Service (Amazon Web Services KMS), you
// must also have the kms:GenerateDataKey and kms:Decrypt permissions in IAM
// identity-based policies and KMS key policies for the KMS key to retrieve the
// checksum of the object.
//
// Encryption Encryption request headers, like x-amz-server-side-encryption ,
// should not be sent for HEAD requests if your object uses server-side encryption
// with Key Management Service (KMS) keys (SSE-KMS), dual-layer server-side
// encryption with Amazon Web Services KMS keys (DSSE-KMS), or server-side
// encryption with Amazon S3 managed encryption keys (SSE-S3). The
// x-amz-server-side-encryption header is used when you PUT an object to S3 and
// want to specify the encryption method. If you include this header in a HEAD
// request for an object that uses these types of keys, you’ll get an HTTP 400 Bad
// Request error. It's because the encryption method can't be changed when you
// retrieve the object.
//
// If you encrypt an object by using server-side encryption with customer-provided
// encryption keys (SSE-C) when you store the object in Amazon S3, then when you
// retrieve the metadata from the object, you must use the following headers to
// provide the encryption key for the server to be able to retrieve the object's
// metadata. The headers are:
//
// - x-amz-server-side-encryption-customer-algorithm
//
// - x-amz-server-side-encryption-customer-key
//
// - x-amz-server-side-encryption-customer-key-MD5
//
// For more information about SSE-C, see [Server-Side Encryption (Using Customer-Provided Encryption Keys)] in the Amazon S3 User Guide.
//
// Directory bucket - For directory buckets, there are only two supported options
// for server-side encryption: SSE-S3 and SSE-KMS. SSE-C isn't supported. For more
// information, see [Protecting data with server-side encryption]in the Amazon S3 User Guide.
//
// Versioning
//
// - If the current version of the object is a delete marker, Amazon S3 behaves
// as if the object was deleted and includes x-amz-delete-marker: true in the
// response.
//
// - If the specified version is a delete marker, the response returns a 405
// Method Not Allowed error and the Last-Modified: timestamp response header.
//
// - Directory buckets - Delete marker is not supported for directory buckets.
//
// - Directory buckets - S3 Versioning isn't enabled and supported for directory
// buckets. For this API operation, only the null value of the version ID is
// supported by directory buckets. You can only specify null to the versionId
// query parameter in the request.
//
// HTTP Host header syntax  Directory buckets - The HTTP Host header syntax is
// Bucket-name.s3express-zone-id.region-code.amazonaws.com .
//
// For directory buckets, you must make requests for this API operation to the
// Zonal endpoint. These endpoints support virtual-hosted-style requests in the
// format
// https://amzn-s3-demo-bucket.s3express-zone-id.region-code.amazonaws.com/key-name
// . Path-style requests are not supported. For more information about endpoints
// in Availability Zones, see [Regional and Zonal endpoints for directory buckets in Availability Zones]in the Amazon S3 User Guide. For more information
// about endpoints in Local Zones, see [Concepts for directory buckets in Local Zones]in the Amazon S3 User Guide.
//
// The following actions are related to HeadObject :
//
// [GetObject]
//
// [GetObjectAttributes]
//
// You must URL encode any signed header values that contain spaces. For example,
// if your header value is my file.txt , containing two spaces after my , you must
// URL encode this value to my%20%20file.txt .
