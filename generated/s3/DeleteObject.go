package s3

// DeleteObject is generated as a reference stub.
// Executable command wiring lives under cmd/s3.go.
//
// Removes an object from a bucket. The behavior depends on the bucket's
// versioning state:
//
// - If bucket versioning is not enabled, the operation permanently deletes the
// object.
//
// - If bucket versioning is enabled, the operation inserts a delete marker,
// which becomes the current version of the object. To permanently delete an object
// in a versioned bucket, you must include the object’s versionId in the request.
// For more information about versioning-enabled buckets, see [Deleting object versions from a versioning-enabled bucket].
//
// - If bucket versioning is suspended, the operation removes the object that
// has a null versionId , if there is one, and inserts a delete marker that
// becomes the current version of the object. If there isn't an object with a null
// versionId , and all versions of the object have a versionId , Amazon S3 does
// not remove the object and only inserts a delete marker. To permanently delete an
// object that has a versionId , you must include the object’s versionId in the
// request. For more information about versioning-suspended buckets, see [Deleting objects from versioning-suspended buckets].
//
// - Directory buckets - S3 Versioning isn't enabled and supported for directory
// buckets. For this API operation, only the null value of the version ID is
// supported by directory buckets. You can only specify null to the versionId
// query parameter in the request.
//
// - Directory buckets - For directory buckets, you must make requests for this
// API operation to the Zonal endpoint. These endpoints support
// virtual-hosted-style requests in the format
// https://amzn-s3-demo-bucket.s3express-zone-id.region-code.amazonaws.com/key-name
// . Path-style requests are not supported. For more information about endpoints
// in Availability Zones, see [Regional and Zonal endpoints for directory buckets in Availability Zones]in the Amazon S3 User Guide. For more information
// about endpoints in Local Zones, see [Concepts for directory buckets in Local Zones]in the Amazon S3 User Guide.
//
// To remove a specific version, you must use the versionId query parameter. Using
// this query parameter permanently deletes the version. If the object deleted is a
// delete marker, Amazon S3 sets the response header x-amz-delete-marker to true.
//
// If the object you want to delete is in a bucket where the bucket versioning
// configuration is MFA Delete enabled, you must include the x-amz-mfa request
// header in the DELETE versionId request. Requests that include x-amz-mfa must
// use HTTPS. For more information about MFA Delete, see [Using MFA Delete]in the Amazon S3 User
// Guide. To see sample requests that use versioning, see [Sample Request].
//
// Directory buckets - MFA delete is not supported by directory buckets.
//
// You can delete objects by explicitly calling DELETE Object or calling ([PutBucketLifecycle] ) to
// enable Amazon S3 to remove them for you. If you want to block users or accounts
// from removing or deleting objects from your bucket, you must deny them the
// s3:DeleteObject , s3:DeleteObjectVersion , and s3:PutLifeCycleConfiguration
// actions.
//
// Directory buckets - S3 Lifecycle is not supported by directory buckets.
//
// Permissions
//
// - General purpose bucket permissions - The following permissions are required
// in your policies when your DeleteObjects request includes specific headers.
//
// - s3:DeleteObject - To delete an object from a bucket, you must always have
// the s3:DeleteObject permission.
//
// - s3:DeleteObjectVersion - To delete a specific version of an object from a
// versioning-enabled bucket, you must have the s3:DeleteObjectVersion permission.
//
// If the s3:DeleteObject or s3:DeleteObjectVersion permissions are explicitly
//
// denied in your bucket policy, attempts to delete any unversioned objects result
// in a 403 Access Denied error.
//
// - Directory bucket permissions - To grant access to this API operation on a
// directory bucket, we recommend that you use the [CreateSession]CreateSession API operation
// for session-based authorization. Specifically, you grant the
// s3express:CreateSession permission to the directory bucket in a bucket policy
// or an IAM identity-based policy. Then, you make the CreateSession API call on
// the bucket to obtain a session token. With the session token in your request
// header, you can make API requests to this operation. After the session token
// expires, you make another CreateSession API call to generate a new session
// token for use. Amazon Web Services CLI or SDKs create session and refresh the
// session token automatically to avoid service interruptions when a session
// expires. For more information about authorization, see [CreateSession]CreateSession .
//
// HTTP Host header syntax  Directory buckets - The HTTP Host header syntax is
// Bucket-name.s3express-zone-id.region-code.amazonaws.com .
//
// The following action is related to DeleteObject :
//
// [PutObject]
//
// You must URL encode any signed header values that contain spaces. For example,
// if your header value is my file.txt , containing two spaces after my , you must
// URL encode this value to my%20%20file.txt .
//
// The If-Match header is supported for both general purpose and directory
// buckets. IfMatchLastModifiedTime and IfMatchSize is only supported for
// directory buckets.
