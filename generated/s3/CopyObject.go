package s3

// CopyObject is generated as a reference stub.
// Executable command wiring lives under cmd/s3.go.
//
// Creates a copy of an object that is already stored in Amazon S3.
//
// End of support notice: As of October 1, 2025, Amazon S3 has discontinued
// support for Email Grantee Access Control Lists (ACLs). If you attempt to use an
// Email Grantee ACL in a request after October 1, 2025, the request will receive
// an HTTP 405 (Method Not Allowed) error.
//
// This change affects the following Amazon Web Services Regions: US East (N.
// Virginia), US West (N. California), US West (Oregon), Asia Pacific (Singapore),
// Asia Pacific (Sydney), Asia Pacific (Tokyo), Europe (Ireland), and South America
// (São Paulo).
//
// You can store individual objects of up to 50 TB in Amazon S3. You create a copy
// of your object up to 5 GB in size in a single atomic action using this API.
// However, to copy an object greater than 5 GB, you must use the multipart upload
// Upload Part - Copy (UploadPartCopy) API. For more information, see [Copy Object Using the REST Multipart Upload API].
//
// You can copy individual objects between general purpose buckets, between
// directory buckets, and between general purpose buckets and directory buckets.
//
// - Amazon S3 supports copy operations using Multi-Region Access Points only as
// a destination when using the Multi-Region Access Point ARN.
//
// - Directory buckets - For directory buckets, you must make requests for this
// API operation to the Zonal endpoint. These endpoints support
// virtual-hosted-style requests in the format
// https://amzn-s3-demo-bucket.s3express-zone-id.region-code.amazonaws.com/key-name
// . Path-style requests are not supported. For more information about endpoints
// in Availability Zones, see [Regional and Zonal endpoints for directory buckets in Availability Zones]in the Amazon S3 User Guide. For more information
// about endpoints in Local Zones, see [Concepts for directory buckets in Local Zones]in the Amazon S3 User Guide.
//
// - VPC endpoints don't support cross-Region requests (including copies). If
// you're using VPC endpoints, your source and destination buckets should be in the
// same Amazon Web Services Region as your VPC endpoint.
//
// Both the Region that you want to copy the object from and the Region that you
// want to copy the object to must be enabled for your account. For more
// information about how to enable a Region for your account, see [Enable or disable a Region for standalone accounts]in the Amazon
// Web Services Account Management Guide.
//
// Amazon S3 transfer acceleration does not support cross-Region copies. If you
// request a cross-Region copy using a transfer acceleration endpoint, you get a
// 400 Bad Request error. For more information, see [Transfer Acceleration].
//
// Authentication and authorization All CopyObject requests must be authenticated
// and signed by using IAM credentials (access key ID and secret access key for the
// IAM identities). All headers with the x-amz- prefix, including x-amz-copy-source
// , must be signed. For more information, see [REST Authentication].
//
// Directory buckets - You must use the IAM credentials to authenticate and
// authorize your access to the CopyObject API operation, instead of using the
// temporary security credentials through the CreateSession API operation.
//
// Amazon Web Services CLI or SDKs handles authentication and authorization on
// your behalf.
//
// Permissions You must have read access to the source object and write access to
// the destination bucket.
//
// - General purpose bucket permissions - You must have permissions in an IAM
// policy based on the source and destination bucket types in a CopyObject
// operation.
//
// - If the source object is in a general purpose bucket, you must have
// s3:GetObject permission to read the source object that is being copied.
//
// - If the destination bucket is a general purpose bucket, you must have
// s3:PutObject permission to write the object copy to the destination bucket.
//
// - Directory bucket permissions - You must have permissions in a bucket policy
// or an IAM identity-based policy based on the source and destination bucket types
// in a CopyObject operation.
//
// - If the source object that you want to copy is in a directory bucket, you
// must have the s3express:CreateSession permission in the Action element of a
// policy to read the object. By default, the session is in the ReadWrite mode.
// If you want to restrict the access, you can explicitly set the
// s3express:SessionMode condition key to ReadOnly on the copy source bucket.
//
// - If the copy destination is a directory bucket, you must have the
// s3express:CreateSession permission in the Action element of a policy to write
// the object to the destination. The s3express:SessionMode condition key can't
// be set to ReadOnly on the copy destination bucket.
//
// If the object is encrypted with SSE-KMS, you must also have the
//
// kms:GenerateDataKey and kms:Decrypt permissions in IAM identity-based policies
// and KMS key policies for the KMS key.
//
// For example policies, see [Example bucket policies for S3 Express One Zone]and [Amazon Web Services Identity and Access Management (IAM) identity-based policies for S3 Express One Zone]in the Amazon S3 User Guide.
//
// Response and special errors When the request is an HTTP 1.1 request, the
// response is chunk encoded. When the request is not an HTTP 1.1 request, the
// response would not contain the Content-Length . You always need to read the
// entire response body to check if the copy succeeds.
//
// - If the copy is successful, you receive a response with information about
// the copied object.
//
// - A copy request might return an error when Amazon S3 receives the copy
// request or while Amazon S3 is copying the files. A 200 OK response can contain
// either a success or an error.
//
// - If the error occurs before the copy action starts, you receive a standard
// Amazon S3 error.
//
// - If the error occurs during the copy operation, the error response is
// embedded in the 200 OK response. For example, in a cross-region copy, you may
// encounter throttling and receive a 200 OK response. For more information, see [Resolve the Error 200 response when copying objects to Amazon S3]
// . The 200 OK status code means the copy was accepted, but it doesn't mean the
// copy is complete. Another example is when you disconnect from Amazon S3 before
// the copy is complete, Amazon S3 might cancel the copy and you may receive a
// 200 OK response. You must stay connected to Amazon S3 until the entire
// response is successfully received and processed.
//
// If you call this API operation directly, make sure to design your application
//
// to parse the content of the response and handle it appropriately. If you use
// Amazon Web Services SDKs, SDKs handle this condition. The SDKs detect the
// embedded error and apply error handling per your configuration settings
// (including automatically retrying the request as appropriate). If the condition
// persists, the SDKs throw an exception (or, for the SDKs that don't use
// exceptions, they return an error).
//
// Charge The copy request charge is based on the storage class and Region that
// you specify for the destination object. The request can also result in a data
// retrieval charge for the source if the source storage class bills for data
// retrieval. If the copy source is in a different region, the data transfer is
// billed to the copy source account. For pricing information, see [Amazon S3 pricing].
//
// HTTP Host header syntax
//
// - Directory buckets - The HTTP Host header syntax is
// Bucket-name.s3express-zone-id.region-code.amazonaws.com .
//
// - Amazon S3 on Outposts - When you use this action with S3 on Outposts
// through the REST API, you must direct requests to the S3 on Outposts hostname.
// The S3 on Outposts hostname takes the form
// AccessPointName-AccountId.outpostID.s3-outposts.Region.amazonaws.com . The
// hostname isn't required when you use the Amazon Web Services CLI or SDKs.
//
// The following operations are related to CopyObject :
//
// [PutObject]
//
// [GetObject]
//
// You must URL encode any signed header values that contain spaces. For example,
// if your header value is my file.txt , containing two spaces after my , you must
// URL encode this value to my%20%20file.txt .
