// AbortMultipartUpload is generated as a reference stub.
// Executable command wiring lives under cmd/s3.go.
//
// This operation aborts a multipart upload. After a multipart upload is aborted,
// no additional parts can be uploaded using that upload ID. The storage consumed
// by any previously uploaded parts will be freed. However, if any part uploads are
// currently in progress, those part uploads might or might not succeed. As a
// result, it might be necessary to abort a given multipart upload multiple times
// in order to completely free all storage consumed by all parts.
//
// To verify that all parts have been removed and prevent getting charged for the
// part storage, you should call the [ListParts]API operation and ensure that the parts list
// is empty.
//
// - Directory buckets - If multipart uploads in a directory bucket are in
// progress, you can't delete the bucket until all the in-progress multipart
// uploads are aborted or completed. To delete these in-progress multipart uploads,
// use the ListMultipartUploads operation to list the in-progress multipart
// uploads in the bucket and use the AbortMultipartUpload operation to abort all
// the in-progress multipart uploads.
//
// - Directory buckets - For directory buckets, you must make requests for this
// API operation to the Zonal endpoint. These endpoints support
// virtual-hosted-style requests in the format
// https://amzn-s3-demo-bucket.s3express-zone-id.region-code.amazonaws.com/key-name
// . Path-style requests are not supported. For more information about endpoints
// in Availability Zones, see [Regional and Zonal endpoints for directory buckets in Availability Zones]in the Amazon S3 User Guide. For more information
// about endpoints in Local Zones, see [Concepts for directory buckets in Local Zones]in the Amazon S3 User Guide.
//
// Permissions
//
// - General purpose bucket permissions - For information about permissions
// required to use the multipart upload, see [Multipart Upload and Permissions]in the Amazon S3 User Guide.
//
// - Directory bucket permissions - To grant access to this API operation on a
// directory bucket, we recommend that you use the [CreateSession]CreateSession API operation
// for session-based authorization. Specifically, you grant the
// s3express:CreateSession permission to the directory bucket in a bucket policy
// or an IAM identity-based policy. Then, you make the CreateSession API call on
// the bucket to obtain a session token. With the session token in your request
// header, you can make API requests to this operation. After the session token
// expires, you make another CreateSession API call to generate a new session
// token for use. Amazon Web Services CLI or SDKs create session and refresh the
// session token automatically to avoid service interruptions when a session
// expires. For more information about authorization, see [CreateSession]CreateSession .
//
// HTTP Host header syntax  Directory buckets - The HTTP Host header syntax is
// Bucket-name.s3express-zone-id.region-code.amazonaws.com .
//
// The following operations are related to AbortMultipartUpload :
//
// [CreateMultipartUpload]
//
// [UploadPart]
//
// [CompleteMultipartUpload]
//
// [ListParts]
//
// [ListMultipartUploads]
//
// You must URL encode any signed header values that contain spaces. For example,
// if your header value is my file.txt , containing two spaces after my , you must
// URL encode this value to my%20%20file.txt .
