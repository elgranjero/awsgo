package s3

// CreateSession is generated as a reference stub.
// Executable command wiring lives under cmd/s3.go.
//
// Creates a session that establishes temporary security credentials to support
// fast authentication and authorization for the Zonal endpoint API operations on
// directory buckets. For more information about Zonal endpoint API operations that
// include the Availability Zone in the request endpoint, see [S3 Express One Zone APIs]in the Amazon S3
// User Guide.
//
// To make Zonal endpoint API requests on a directory bucket, use the CreateSession
// API operation. Specifically, you grant s3express:CreateSession permission to a
// bucket in a bucket policy or an IAM identity-based policy. Then, you use IAM
// credentials to make the CreateSession API request on the bucket, which returns
// temporary security credentials that include the access key ID, secret access
// key, session token, and expiration. These credentials have associated
// permissions to access the Zonal endpoint API operations. After the session is
// created, you don’t need to use other policies to grant permissions to each Zonal
// endpoint API individually. Instead, in your Zonal endpoint API requests, you
// sign your requests by applying the temporary security credentials of the session
// to the request headers and following the SigV4 protocol for authentication. You
// also apply the session token to the x-amz-s3session-token request header for
// authorization. Temporary security credentials are scoped to the bucket and
// expire after 5 minutes. After the expiration time, any calls that you make with
// those credentials will fail. You must use IAM credentials again to make a
// CreateSession API request that generates a new set of temporary credentials for
// use. Temporary credentials cannot be extended or refreshed beyond the original
// specified interval.
//
// If you use Amazon Web Services SDKs, SDKs handle the session token refreshes
// automatically to avoid service interruptions when a session expires. We
// recommend that you use the Amazon Web Services SDKs to initiate and manage
// requests to the CreateSession API. For more information, see [Performance guidelines and design patterns]in the Amazon S3
// User Guide.
//
// - You must make requests for this API operation to the Zonal endpoint. These
// endpoints support virtual-hosted-style requests in the format
// https://bucket-name.s3express-zone-id.region-code.amazonaws.com . Path-style
// requests are not supported. For more information about endpoints in Availability
// Zones, see [Regional and Zonal endpoints for directory buckets in Availability Zones]in the Amazon S3 User Guide. For more information about endpoints
// in Local Zones, see [Concepts for directory buckets in Local Zones]in the Amazon S3 User Guide.
//
// - CopyObject API operation - Unlike other Zonal endpoint API operations, the
// CopyObject API operation doesn't use the temporary security credentials
// returned from the CreateSession API operation for authentication and
// authorization. For information about authentication and authorization of the
// CopyObject API operation on directory buckets, see [CopyObject].
//
// - HeadBucket API operation - Unlike other Zonal endpoint API operations, the
// HeadBucket API operation doesn't use the temporary security credentials
// returned from the CreateSession API operation for authentication and
// authorization. For information about authentication and authorization of the
// HeadBucket API operation on directory buckets, see [HeadBucket].
//
// Permissions To obtain temporary security credentials, you must create a bucket
// policy or an IAM identity-based policy that grants s3express:CreateSession
// permission to the bucket. In a policy, you can have the s3express:SessionMode
// condition key to control who can create a ReadWrite or ReadOnly session. For
// more information about ReadWrite or ReadOnly sessions, see [x-amz-create-session-mode]
// x-amz-create-session-mode . For example policies, see [Example bucket policies for S3 Express One Zone] and [Amazon Web Services Identity and Access Management (IAM) identity-based policies for S3 Express One Zone] in the Amazon S3
// User Guide.
//
// To grant cross-account access to Zonal endpoint API operations, the bucket
// policy should also grant both accounts the s3express:CreateSession permission.
//
// If you want to encrypt objects with SSE-KMS, you must also have the
// kms:GenerateDataKey and the kms:Decrypt permissions in IAM identity-based
// policies and KMS key policies for the target KMS key.
//
// Encryption For directory buckets, there are only two supported options for
// server-side encryption: server-side encryption with Amazon S3 managed keys
// (SSE-S3) ( AES256 ) and server-side encryption with KMS keys (SSE-KMS) ( aws:kms
// ). We recommend that the bucket's default encryption uses the desired encryption
// configuration and you don't override the bucket default encryption in your
// CreateSession requests or PUT object requests. Then, new objects are
// automatically encrypted with the desired encryption settings. For more
// information, see [Protecting data with server-side encryption]in the Amazon S3 User Guide. For more information about the
// encryption overriding behaviors in directory buckets, see [Specifying server-side encryption with KMS for new object uploads].
//
// For [Zonal endpoint (object-level) API operations] except [CopyObject] and [UploadPartCopy], you authenticate and authorize requests through [CreateSession] for low
// latency. To encrypt new objects in a directory bucket with SSE-KMS, you must
// specify SSE-KMS as the directory bucket's default encryption configuration with
// a KMS key (specifically, a [customer managed key]). Then, when a session is created for Zonal
// endpoint API operations, new objects are automatically encrypted and decrypted
// with SSE-KMS and S3 Bucket Keys during the session.
//
// Only 1 [customer managed key] is supported per directory bucket for the lifetime of the bucket. The [Amazon Web Services managed key] (
// aws/s3 ) isn't supported. After you specify SSE-KMS as your bucket's default
// encryption configuration with a customer managed key, you can't change the
// customer managed key for the bucket's SSE-KMS configuration.
//
// In the Zonal endpoint API calls (except [CopyObject] and [UploadPartCopy]) using the REST API, you can't
// override the values of the encryption settings ( x-amz-server-side-encryption ,
// x-amz-server-side-encryption-aws-kms-key-id ,
// x-amz-server-side-encryption-context , and
// x-amz-server-side-encryption-bucket-key-enabled ) from the CreateSession
// request. You don't need to explicitly specify these encryption settings values
// in Zonal endpoint API calls, and Amazon S3 will use the encryption settings
// values from the CreateSession request to protect new objects in the directory
// bucket.
//
// When you use the CLI or the Amazon Web Services SDKs, for CreateSession , the
// session token refreshes automatically to avoid service interruptions when a
// session expires. The CLI or the Amazon Web Services SDKs use the bucket's
// default encryption configuration for the CreateSession request. It's not
// supported to override the encryption settings values in the CreateSession
// request. Also, in the Zonal endpoint API calls (except [CopyObject]and [UploadPartCopy]), it's not
// supported to override the values of the encryption settings from the
// CreateSession request.
//
// HTTP Host header syntax  Directory buckets - The HTTP Host header syntax is
// Bucket-name.s3express-zone-id.region-code.amazonaws.com .
//
// You must URL encode any signed header values that contain spaces. For example,
// if your header value is my file.txt , containing two spaces after my , you must
// URL encode this value to my%20%20file.txt .
