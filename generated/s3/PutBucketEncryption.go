// PutBucketEncryption is generated as a reference stub.
// Executable command wiring lives under cmd/s3.go.
//
// This operation configures default encryption and Amazon S3 Bucket Keys for an
// existing bucket. You can also [block encryption types]using this operation.
//
// Directory buckets - For directory buckets, you must make requests for this API
// operation to the Regional endpoint. These endpoints support path-style requests
// in the format https://s3express-control.region-code.amazonaws.com/bucket-name .
// Virtual-hosted-style requests aren't supported. For more information about
// endpoints in Availability Zones, see [Regional and Zonal endpoints for directory buckets in Availability Zones]in the Amazon S3 User Guide. For more
// information about endpoints in Local Zones, see [Concepts for directory buckets in Local Zones]in the Amazon S3 User Guide.
//
// By default, all buckets have a default encryption configuration that uses
// server-side encryption with Amazon S3 managed keys (SSE-S3).
//
// - General purpose buckets
//
// - You can optionally configure default encryption for a bucket by using
// server-side encryption with Key Management Service (KMS) keys (SSE-KMS) or
// dual-layer server-side encryption with Amazon Web Services KMS keys (DSSE-KMS).
// If you specify default encryption by using SSE-KMS, you can also configure [Amazon S3 Bucket Keys].
// For information about the bucket default encryption feature, see [Amazon S3 Bucket Default Encryption]in the
// Amazon S3 User Guide.
//
// - If you use PutBucketEncryption to set your [default bucket encryption]to SSE-KMS, you should verify
// that your KMS key ID is correct. Amazon S3 doesn't validate the KMS key ID
// provided in PutBucketEncryption requests.
//
// - Directory buckets - You can optionally configure default encryption for a
// bucket by using server-side encryption with Key Management Service (KMS) keys
// (SSE-KMS).
//
// - We recommend that the bucket's default encryption uses the desired
// encryption configuration and you don't override the bucket default encryption in
// your CreateSession requests or PUT object requests. Then, new objects are
// automatically encrypted with the desired encryption settings. For more
// information about the encryption overriding behaviors in directory buckets, see [Specifying server-side encryption with KMS for new object uploads]
// .
//
// - Your SSE-KMS configuration can only support 1 [customer managed key]per directory bucket's
// lifetime. The [Amazon Web Services managed key]( aws/s3 ) isn't supported.
//
// - S3 Bucket Keys are always enabled for GET and PUT operations in a directory
// bucket and can’t be disabled. S3 Bucket Keys aren't supported, when you copy
// SSE-KMS encrypted objects from general purpose buckets to directory buckets,
// from directory buckets to general purpose buckets, or between directory buckets,
// through [CopyObject], [UploadPartCopy], [the Copy operation in Batch Operations], or [the import jobs]. In this case, Amazon S3 makes a call to KMS every time a
// copy request is made for a KMS-encrypted object.
//
// - When you specify an [KMS customer managed key]for encryption in your directory bucket, only use the
// key ID or key ARN. The key alias format of the KMS key isn't supported.
//
// - For directory buckets, if you use PutBucketEncryption to set your [default bucket encryption]to
// SSE-KMS, Amazon S3 validates the KMS key ID provided in PutBucketEncryption
// requests.
//
// If you're specifying a customer managed KMS key, we recommend using a fully
// qualified KMS key ARN. If you use a KMS key alias instead, then KMS resolves the
// key within the requester’s account. This behavior can result in data that's
// encrypted with a KMS key that belongs to the requester, and not the bucket
// owner.
//
// Also, this action requires Amazon Web Services Signature Version 4. For more
// information, see [Authenticating Requests (Amazon Web Services Signature Version 4)].
//
// Permissions
//
// - General purpose bucket permissions - The s3:PutEncryptionConfiguration
// permission is required in a policy. The bucket owner has this permission by
// default. The bucket owner can grant this permission to others. For more
// information about permissions, see [Permissions Related to Bucket Operations]and [Managing Access Permissions to Your Amazon S3 Resources]in the Amazon S3 User Guide.
//
// - Directory bucket permissions - To grant access to this API operation, you
// must have the s3express:PutEncryptionConfiguration permission in an IAM
// identity-based policy instead of a bucket policy. Cross-account access to this
// API operation isn't supported. This operation can only be performed by the
// Amazon Web Services account that owns the resource. For more information about
// directory bucket policies and permissions, see [Amazon Web Services Identity and Access Management (IAM) for S3 Express One Zone]in the Amazon S3 User Guide.
//
// To set a directory bucket default encryption with SSE-KMS, you must also have
//
// the kms:GenerateDataKey and the kms:Decrypt permissions in IAM identity-based
// policies and KMS key policies for the target KMS key.
//
// HTTP Host header syntax  Directory buckets - The HTTP Host header syntax is
// s3express-control.region-code.amazonaws.com .
//
// The following operations are related to PutBucketEncryption :
//
// [GetBucketEncryption]
//
// [DeleteBucketEncryption]
//
// You must URL encode any signed header values that contain spaces. For example,
// if your header value is my file.txt , containing two spaces after my , you must
// URL encode this value to my%20%20file.txt .
