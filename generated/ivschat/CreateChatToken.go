// CreateChatToken is generated as a reference stub.
// Executable command wiring lives under cmd/ivschat.go.
//
// Creates an encrypted token that is used by a chat participant to establish an
// individual WebSocket chat connection to a room. When the token is used to
// connect to chat, the connection is valid for the session duration specified in
// the request. The token becomes invalid at the token-expiration timestamp
// included in the response.
//
// Use the capabilities field to permit an end user to send messages or moderate a
// room.
//
// The attributes field securely attaches structured data to the chat session; the
// data is included within each message sent by the end user and received by other
// participants in the room. Common use cases for attributes include passing
// end-user profile data like an icon, display name, colors, badges, and other
// display features.
//
// Encryption keys are owned by Amazon IVS Chat and never used directly by your
// application.
