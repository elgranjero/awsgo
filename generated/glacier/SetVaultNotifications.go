// SetVaultNotifications is generated as a reference stub.
// Executable command wiring lives under cmd/glacier.go.
//
// This operation configures notifications that will be sent when specific events
// happen to a vault. By default, you don't get any notifications.
//
// To configure vault notifications, send a PUT request to the
// notification-configuration subresource of the vault. The request should include
// a JSON document that provides an Amazon SNS topic and specific events for which
// you want Amazon Glacier to send notifications to the topic.
//
// Amazon SNS topics must grant permission to the vault to be allowed to publish
// notifications to the topic. You can configure a vault to publish a notification
// for the following vault events:
//
// - ArchiveRetrievalCompleted This event occurs when a job that was initiated
// for an archive retrieval is completed (InitiateJob ). The status of the completed job can
// be "Succeeded" or "Failed". The notification sent to the SNS topic is the same
// output as returned from DescribeJob.
//
// - InventoryRetrievalCompleted This event occurs when a job that was initiated
// for an inventory retrieval is completed (InitiateJob ). The status of the completed job
// can be "Succeeded" or "Failed". The notification sent to the SNS topic is the
// same output as returned from DescribeJob.
//
// An AWS account has full permission to perform all operations (actions).
// However, AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) users don't have any
// permissions by default. You must grant them explicit permission to perform
// specific actions. For more information, see [Access Control Using AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM)].
//
// For conceptual information and underlying REST API, see [Configuring Vault Notifications in Amazon Glacier] and [Set Vault Notification Configuration] in the Amazon
// Glacier Developer Guide.
