// DeleteVaultNotifications is generated as a reference stub.
// Executable command wiring lives under cmd/glacier.go.
//
// This operation deletes the notification configuration set for a vault. The
// operation is eventually consistent; that is, it might take some time for Amazon
// Glacier to completely disable the notifications and you might still receive some
// notifications for a short time after you send the delete request.
//
// An AWS account has full permission to perform all operations (actions).
// However, AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) users don't have any
// permissions by default. You must grant them explicit permission to perform
// specific actions. For more information, see [Access Control Using AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM)].
//
// For conceptual information and underlying REST API, see [Configuring Vault Notifications in Amazon Glacier] and [Delete Vault Notification Configuration] in the Amazon
// Glacier Developer Guide.
