// Executable command wiring lives under cmd/marketplacemetering.go.
//
// Paid container software products sold through Amazon Web Services Marketplace
// must integrate with the Amazon Web Services Marketplace Metering Service and
// call the RegisterUsage operation for software entitlement and metering. Free
// and BYOL products for Amazon ECS or Amazon EKS aren't required to call
// RegisterUsage , but you may choose to do so if you would like to receive usage
// data in your seller reports. The sections below explain the behavior of
// RegisterUsage . RegisterUsage performs two primary functions: metering and
// entitlement.
//
// - Entitlement: RegisterUsage allows you to verify that the customer running
// your paid software is subscribed to your product on Amazon Web Services
// Marketplace, enabling you to guard against unauthorized use. Your container
// image that integrates with RegisterUsage is only required to guard against
// unauthorized use at container startup, as such a
// CustomerNotSubscribedException or PlatformNotSupportedException will only be
// thrown on the initial call to RegisterUsage . Subsequent calls from the same
// Amazon ECS task instance (e.g. task-id) or Amazon EKS pod will not throw a
// CustomerNotSubscribedException , even if the customer unsubscribes while the
// Amazon ECS task or Amazon EKS pod is still running.
//
// - Metering: RegisterUsage meters software use per ECS task, per hour, or per
// pod for Amazon EKS with usage prorated to the second. A minimum of 1 minute of
// usage applies to tasks that are short lived. For example, if a customer has a 10
// node Amazon ECS or Amazon EKS cluster and a service configured as a Daemon Set,
// then Amazon ECS or Amazon EKS will launch a task on all 10 cluster nodes and the
// customer will be charged for 10 tasks. Software metering is handled by the
// Amazon Web Services Marketplace metering control plane—your software is not
// required to perform metering-specific actions other than to call RegisterUsage
// to commence metering. The Amazon Web Services Marketplace metering control plane
// will also bill customers for running ECS tasks and Amazon EKS pods, regardless
// of the customer's subscription state, which removes the need for your software
// to run entitlement checks at runtime. For containers, RegisterUsage should be
// called immediately at launch. If you don’t register the container within the
// first 6 hours of the launch, Amazon Web Services Marketplace Metering Service
// doesn’t provide any metering guarantees for previous months. Metering will
// continue, however, for the current month forward until the container ends.
// RegisterUsage is for metering paid hourly container products.
//
