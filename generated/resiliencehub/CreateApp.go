//
// Creates an Resilience Hub application. An Resilience Hub application is a
// collection of Amazon Web Services resources structured to prevent and recover
// Amazon Web Services application disruptions. To describe a Resilience Hub
// application, you provide an application name, resources from one or more
// CloudFormation stacks, Resource Groups, Terraform state files, AppRegistry
// applications, and an appropriate resiliency policy. In addition, you can also
// add resources that are located on Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (Amazon EKS)
// clusters as optional resources. For more information about the number of
// resources supported per application, see [Service quotas].
//
// After you create an Resilience Hub application, you publish it so that you can
// run a resiliency assessment on it. You can then use recommendations from the
// assessment to improve resiliency by running another assessment, comparing
// results, and then iterating the process until you achieve your goals for
// recovery time objective (RTO) and recovery point objective (RPO).
