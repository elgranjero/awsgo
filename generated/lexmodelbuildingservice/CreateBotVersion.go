package lexmodelbuildingservice

// CreateBotVersion is generated as a reference stub.
// Executable command wiring lives under cmd/lexmodelbuildingservice.go.
//
// Creates a new version of the bot based on the $LATEST version. If the $LATEST
// version of this resource hasn't changed since you created the last version,
// Amazon Lex doesn't create a new version. It returns the last created version.
//
// You can update only the $LATEST version of the bot. You can't update the
// numbered versions that you create with the CreateBotVersion operation.
//
// When you create the first version of a bot, Amazon Lex sets the version to 1.
// Subsequent versions increment by 1. For more information, see versioning-intro.
//
// This operation requires permission for the lex:CreateBotVersion action.
