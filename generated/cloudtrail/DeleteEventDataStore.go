package cloudtrail

// DeleteEventDataStore is generated as a reference stub.
// Executable command wiring lives under cmd/cloudtrail.go.
//
// Disables the event data store specified by EventDataStore , which accepts an
// event data store ARN. After you run DeleteEventDataStore , the event data store
// enters a PENDING_DELETION state, and is automatically deleted after a wait
// period of seven days. TerminationProtectionEnabled must be set to False on the
// event data store and the FederationStatus must be DISABLED . You cannot delete
// an event data store if TerminationProtectionEnabled is True or the
// FederationStatus is ENABLED .
//
// After you run DeleteEventDataStore on an event data store, you cannot run
// ListQueries , DescribeQuery , or GetQueryResults on queries that are using an
// event data store in a PENDING_DELETION state. An event data store in the
// PENDING_DELETION state does not incur costs.
