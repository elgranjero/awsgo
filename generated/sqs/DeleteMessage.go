// DeleteMessage is generated as a reference stub.
// Executable command wiring lives under cmd/sqs.go.
//
// Deletes the specified message from the specified queue. To select the message
// to delete, use the ReceiptHandle of the message (not the MessageId which you
// receive when you send the message). Amazon SQS can delete a message from a queue
// even if a visibility timeout setting causes the message to be locked by another
// consumer. Amazon SQS automatically deletes messages left in a queue longer than
// the retention period configured for the queue.
//
// Each time you receive a message, meaning when a consumer retrieves a message
// from the queue, it comes with a unique ReceiptHandle . If you receive the same
// message more than once, you will get a different ReceiptHandle each time. When
// you want to delete a message using the DeleteMessage action, you must use the
// ReceiptHandle from the most recent time you received the message. If you use an
// old ReceiptHandle , the request will succeed, but the message might not be
// deleted.
//
// For standard queues, it is possible to receive a message even after you delete
// it. This might happen on rare occasions if one of the servers which stores a
// copy of the message is unavailable when you send the request to delete the
// message. The copy remains on the server and might be returned to you during a
// subsequent receive request. You should ensure that your application is
// idempotent, so that receiving a message more than once does not cause issues.
