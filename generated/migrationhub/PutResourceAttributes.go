package migrationhub

// PutResourceAttributes is generated as a reference stub.
// Executable command wiring lives under cmd/migrationhub.go.
//
// Provides identifying details of the resource being migrated so that it can be
// associated in the Application Discovery Service repository. This association
// occurs asynchronously after PutResourceAttributes returns.
//
// - Keep in mind that subsequent calls to PutResourceAttributes will override
// previously stored attributes. For example, if it is first called with a MAC
// address, but later, it is desired to add an IP address, it will then be required
// to call it with both the IP and MAC addresses to prevent overriding the MAC
// address.
//
// - Note the instructions regarding the special use case of the [ResourceAttributeList]
// ResourceAttributeList parameter when specifying any "VM" related value.
//
// Because this is an asynchronous call, it will always return 200, whether an
// association occurs or not. To confirm if an association was found based on the
// provided details, call ListDiscoveredResources .
