package sts

// GetAccessKeyInfo is generated as a reference stub.
// Executable command wiring lives under cmd/sts.go.
//
// Returns the account identifier for the specified access key ID.
//
// Access keys consist of two parts: an access key ID (for example,
// AKIAIOSFODNN7EXAMPLE ) and a secret access key (for example,
// wJalrXUtnFEMI/K7MDENG/bPxRfiCYEXAMPLEKEY ). For more information about access
// keys, see [Managing Access Keys for IAM Users]in the IAM User Guide.
//
// When you pass an access key ID to this operation, it returns the ID of the
// Amazon Web Services account to which the keys belong. Access key IDs beginning
// with AKIA are long-term credentials for an IAM user or the Amazon Web Services
// account root user. Access key IDs beginning with ASIA are temporary credentials
// that are created using STS operations. If the account in the response belongs to
// you, you can sign in as the root user and review your root user access keys.
// Then, you can pull a [credentials report]to learn which IAM user owns the keys. To learn who
// requested the temporary credentials for an ASIA access key, view the STS events
// in your [CloudTrail logs]in the IAM User Guide.
//
// This operation does not indicate the state of the access key. The key might be
// active, inactive, or deleted. Active keys might not have permissions to perform
// an operation. Providing a deleted access key might return an error that the key
// doesn't exist.
