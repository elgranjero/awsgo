package batch

// SubmitJob is generated as a reference stub.
// Executable command wiring lives under cmd/batch.go.
//
// Submits an Batch job from a job definition. Parameters that are specified
// during SubmitJoboverride parameters defined in the job definition. vCPU and memory
// requirements that are specified in the resourceRequirements objects in the job
// definition are the exception. They can't be overridden this way using the memory
// and vcpus parameters. Rather, you must specify updates to job definition
// parameters in a resourceRequirements object that's included in the
// containerOverrides parameter.
//
// Job queues with a scheduling policy are limited to 500 active share identifiers
// at a time.
//
// Jobs that run on Fargate resources can't be guaranteed to run for more than 14
// days. This is because, after 14 days, Fargate resources might become unavailable
// and job might be terminated.
