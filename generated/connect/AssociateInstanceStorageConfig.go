package connect

// AssociateInstanceStorageConfig is generated as a reference stub.
// Executable command wiring lives under cmd/connect.go.
//
// This API is in preview release for Amazon Connect and is subject to change.
//
// Associates a storage resource type for the first time. You can only associate
// one type of storage configuration in a single call. This means, for example,
// that you can't define an instance with multiple S3 buckets for storing chat
// transcripts.
//
// This API does not create a resource that doesn't exist. It only associates it
// to the instance. Ensure that the resource being specified in the storage
// configuration, like an S3 bucket, exists when being used for association.
