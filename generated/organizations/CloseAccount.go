// CloseAccount is generated as a reference stub.
// Executable command wiring lives under cmd/organizations.go.
//
// Closes an Amazon Web Services member account within an organization. You can
// close an account when [all features are enabled]. You can't close the management account with this API.
// This is an asynchronous request that Amazon Web Services performs in the
// background. Because CloseAccount operates asynchronously, it can return a
// successful completion message even though account closure might still be in
// progress. You need to wait a few minutes before the account is fully closed. To
// check the status of the request, do one of the following:
//
// - Use the AccountId that you sent in the CloseAccount request to provide as a
// parameter to the DescribeAccountoperation.
//
// While the close account request is in progress, Account status will indicate
//
// PENDING_CLOSURE. When the close account request completes, the status will
// change to SUSPENDED.
//
// - Check the CloudTrail log for the CloseAccountResult event that gets
// published after the account closes successfully. For information on using
// CloudTrail with Organizations, see [Logging and monitoring in Organizations]in the Organizations User Guide.
//
// - Resources remaining within the account after closing will be automatically
// deleted after 90 days. During this 90-day period, the resources won't be
// available unless you contact Amazon Web Services Support to reopen the account.
// After 90 days, you can't reopen an account. You might still receive a [bill after account closure].
//
// - You can close only 10% of member accounts, between 10 and 1000, within a
// rolling 30 day period. This quota is not bound by a calendar month, but starts
// when you close an account. After you reach this limit, you can't close
// additional accounts. For more information, see [Closing a member account in your organization]and [Quotas for Organizations]in the Organizations User
// Guide.
//
// - To reinstate a closed account, contact Amazon Web Services Support within
// the 90-day grace period while the account is in SUSPENDED status.
//
// - If the Amazon Web Services account you attempt to close is linked to an
// Amazon Web Services GovCloud (US) account, the CloseAccount request will close
// both accounts. To learn important pre-closure details, see [Closing an Amazon Web Services GovCloud (US) account]in the Amazon Web
// Services GovCloud User Guide.
