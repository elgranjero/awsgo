// LeaveOrganization is generated as a reference stub.
// Executable command wiring lives under cmd/organizations.go.
//
// Removes a member account from its parent organization. This version of the
// operation is performed by the account that wants to leave. To remove a member
// account as a user in the management account, use RemoveAccountFromOrganizationinstead.
//
// You can only call from operation from a member account.
//
// - The management account in an organization with all features enabled can set
// service control policies (SCPs) that can restrict what administrators of member
// accounts can do. This includes preventing them from successfully calling
// LeaveOrganization and leaving the organization.
//
// - You can leave an organization as a member account only if the account is
// configured with the information required to operate as a standalone account.
// When you create an account in an organization using the Organizations console,
// API, or CLI commands, the information required of standalone accounts is not
// automatically collected. For each account that you want to make standalone, you
// must perform the following steps. If any of the steps are already completed for
// this account, that step doesn't appear.
//
// - Choose a support plan
//
// - Provide and verify the required contact information
//
// - Provide a current payment method
//
// Amazon Web Services uses the payment method to charge for any billable (not
//
// free tier) Amazon Web Services activity that occurs while the account isn't
// attached to an organization. For more information, see [Considerations before removing an account from an organization]in the Organizations
// User Guide.
//
// - The account that you want to leave must not be a delegated administrator
// account for any Amazon Web Services service enabled for your organization. If
// the account is a delegated administrator, you must first change the delegated
// administrator account to another account that is remaining in the organization.
//
// - After the account leaves the organization, all tags that were attached to
// the account object in the organization are deleted. Amazon Web Services accounts
// outside of an organization do not support tags.
//
// - A newly created account has a waiting period before it can be removed from
// its organization. You must wait until at least four days after the account was
// created. Invited accounts aren't subject to this waiting period.
//
// - If you are using an organization principal to call LeaveOrganization across
// multiple accounts, you can only do this up to 5 accounts per second in a single
// organization.
