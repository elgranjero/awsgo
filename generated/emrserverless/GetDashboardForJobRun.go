// GetDashboardForJobRun is generated as a reference stub.
// Executable command wiring lives under cmd/emrserverless.go.
//
// Creates and returns a URL that you can use to access the application UIs for a
// job run.
//
// For jobs in a running state, the application UI is a live user interface such
// as the Spark or Tez web UI. For completed jobs, the application UI is a
// persistent application user interface such as the Spark History Server or
// persistent Tez UI.
//
// The URL is valid for one hour after you generate it. To access the application
// UI after that hour elapses, you must invoke the API again to generate a new URL.
