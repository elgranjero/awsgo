package sagemaker

// CreatePresignedNotebookInstanceUrl is generated as a reference stub.
// Executable command wiring lives under cmd/sagemaker.go.
//
// Returns a URL that you can use to connect to the Jupyter server from a notebook
// instance. In the SageMaker AI console, when you choose Open next to a notebook
// instance, SageMaker AI opens a new tab showing the Jupyter server home page from
// the notebook instance. The console uses this API to get the URL and show the
// page.
//
// The IAM role or user used to call this API defines the permissions to access
// the notebook instance. Once the presigned URL is created, no additional
// permission is required to access this URL. IAM authorization policies for this
// API are also enforced for every HTTP request and WebSocket frame that attempts
// to connect to the notebook instance.
//
// You can restrict access to this API and to the URL that it returns to a list of
// IP addresses that you specify. Use the NotIpAddress condition operator and the
// aws:SourceIP condition context key to specify the list of IP addresses that you
// want to have access to the notebook instance. For more information, see [Limit Access to a Notebook Instance by IP Address].
//
// The URL that you get from a call to [CreatePresignedNotebookInstanceUrl] is valid only for 5 minutes. If you try to
// use the URL after the 5-minute limit expires, you are directed to the Amazon Web
// Services console sign-in page.
