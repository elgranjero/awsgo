// Stops the canary to prevent all future runs. If the canary is currently
// running,the run that is in progress completes on its own, publishes metrics, and
// uploads artifacts, but it is not recorded in Synthetics as a completed run.
//
// You can use StartCanary to start it running again with the canary’s current
// schedule at any point in the future.
