package firehose

// PutRecord is generated as a reference stub.
// Executable command wiring lives under cmd/firehose.go.
//
// Writes a single data record into an Firehose stream. To write multiple data
// records into a Firehose stream, use PutRecordBatch. Applications using these operations are
// referred to as producers.
//
// By default, each Firehose stream can take in up to 2,000 transactions per
// second, 5,000 records per second, or 5 MB per second. If you use PutRecordand PutRecordBatch, the
// limits are an aggregate across these two operations for each Firehose stream.
// For more information about limits and how to request an increase, see [Amazon Firehose Limits].
//
// Firehose accumulates and publishes a particular metric for a customer account
// in one minute intervals. It is possible that the bursts of incoming
// bytes/records ingested to a Firehose stream last only for a few seconds. Due to
// this, the actual spikes in the traffic might not be fully visible in the
// customer's 1 minute CloudWatch metrics.
//
// You must specify the name of the Firehose stream and the data record when using PutRecord
// . The data record consists of a data blob that can be up to 1,000 KiB in size,
// and any kind of data. For example, it can be a segment from a log file,
// geographic location data, website clickstream data, and so on.
//
// For multi record de-aggregation, you can not put more than 500 records even if
// the data blob length is less than 1000 KiB. If you include more than 500
// records, the request succeeds but the record de-aggregation doesn't work as
// expected and transformation lambda is invoked with the complete base64 encoded
// data blob instead of de-aggregated base64 decoded records.
//
// Firehose buffers records before delivering them to the destination. To
// disambiguate the data blobs at the destination, a common solution is to use
// delimiters in the data, such as a newline ( \n ) or some other character unique
// within the data. This allows the consumer application to parse individual data
// items when reading the data from the destination.
//
// The PutRecord operation returns a RecordId , which is a unique string assigned
// to each record. Producer applications can use this ID for purposes such as
// auditability and investigation.
//
// If the PutRecord operation throws a ServiceUnavailableException , the API is
// automatically reinvoked (retried) 3 times. If the exception persists, it is
// possible that the throughput limits have been exceeded for the Firehose stream.
//
// Re-invoking the Put API operations (for example, PutRecord and PutRecordBatch)
// can result in data duplicates. For larger data assets, allow for a longer time
// out before retrying Put API operations.
//
// Data records sent to Firehose are stored for 24 hours from the time they are
// added to a Firehose stream as it tries to send the records to the destination.
// If the destination is unreachable for more than 24 hours, the data is no longer
// available.
//
// Don't concatenate two or more base64 strings to form the data fields of your
// records. Instead, concatenate the raw data, then perform base64 encoding.
