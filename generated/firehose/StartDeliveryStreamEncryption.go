package firehose

// StartDeliveryStreamEncryption is generated as a reference stub.
// Executable command wiring lives under cmd/firehose.go.
//
// Enables server-side encryption (SSE) for the Firehose stream.
//
// This operation is asynchronous. It returns immediately. When you invoke it,
// Firehose first sets the encryption status of the stream to ENABLING , and then
// to ENABLED . The encryption status of a Firehose stream is the Status property
// in DeliveryStreamEncryptionConfiguration. If the operation fails, the encryption status changes to ENABLING_FAILED .
// You can continue to read and write data to your Firehose stream while the
// encryption status is ENABLING , but the data is not encrypted. It can take up to
// 5 seconds after the encryption status changes to ENABLED before all records
// written to the Firehose stream are encrypted. To find out whether a record or a
// batch of records was encrypted, check the response elements PutRecordOutput$Encryptedand PutRecordBatchOutput$Encrypted, respectively.
//
// To check the encryption status of a Firehose stream, use DescribeDeliveryStream.
//
// Even if encryption is currently enabled for a Firehose stream, you can still
// invoke this operation on it to change the ARN of the CMK or both its type and
// ARN. If you invoke this method to change the CMK, and the old CMK is of type
// CUSTOMER_MANAGED_CMK , Firehose schedules the grant it had on the old CMK for
// retirement. If the new CMK is of type CUSTOMER_MANAGED_CMK , Firehose creates a
// grant that enables it to use the new CMK to encrypt and decrypt data and to
// manage the grant.
//
// For the KMS grant creation to be successful, the Firehose API operations
// StartDeliveryStreamEncryption and CreateDeliveryStream should not be called
// with session credentials that are more than 6 hours old.
//
// If a Firehose stream already has encryption enabled and then you invoke this
// operation to change the ARN of the CMK or both its type and ARN and you get
// ENABLING_FAILED , this only means that the attempt to change the CMK failed. In
// this case, encryption remains enabled with the old CMK.
//
// If the encryption status of your Firehose stream is ENABLING_FAILED , you can
// invoke this operation again with a valid CMK. The CMK must be enabled and the
// key policy mustn't explicitly deny the permission for Firehose to invoke KMS
// encrypt and decrypt operations.
//
// You can enable SSE for a Firehose stream only if it's a Firehose stream that
// uses DirectPut as its source.
//
// The StartDeliveryStreamEncryption and StopDeliveryStreamEncryption operations
// have a combined limit of 25 calls per Firehose stream per 24 hours. For example,
// you reach the limit if you call StartDeliveryStreamEncryption 13 times and
// StopDeliveryStreamEncryption 12 times for the same Firehose stream in a 24-hour
// period.
