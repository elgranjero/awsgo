package autoscaling

// AttachInstances is generated as a reference stub.
// Executable command wiring lives under cmd/autoscaling.go.
//
// Attaches one or more EC2 instances to the specified Auto Scaling group.
//
// When you attach instances, Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling increases the desired
// capacity of the group by the number of instances being attached. If the number
// of instances being attached plus the desired capacity of the group exceeds the
// maximum size of the group, the operation fails.
//
// If there is a Classic Load Balancer attached to your Auto Scaling group, the
// instances are also registered with the load balancer. If there are target groups
// attached to your Auto Scaling group, the instances are also registered with the
// target groups.
//
// For more information, see [Detach or attach instances] in the Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling User Guide.
