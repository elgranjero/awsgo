package kinesisvideo

// UpdateDataRetention is generated as a reference stub.
// Executable command wiring lives under cmd/kinesisvideo.go.
//
// Increases or decreases the stream's data retention period by the value that you
// specify. To indicate whether you want to increase or decrease the data retention
// period, specify the Operation parameter in the request body. In the request,
// you must specify either the StreamName or the StreamARN .
//
// This operation requires permission for the KinesisVideo:UpdateDataRetention
// action.
//
// Changing the data retention period affects the data in the stream as follows:
//
// - If the data retention period is increased, existing data is retained for
// the new retention period. For example, if the data retention period is increased
// from one hour to seven hours, all existing data is retained for seven hours.
//
// - If the data retention period is decreased, existing data is retained for
// the new retention period. For example, if the data retention period is decreased
// from seven hours to one hour, all existing data is retained for one hour, and
// any data older than one hour is deleted immediately.
